    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I am a Frontend Developer based in London. In my spare time I enjoy going
      to the Gym, Gaming, and learning/building new projects. <br> My core skills
      include HTML, CSS, Javascript and GIT, but I have also extended my reach
      towards Tailwindcss and VITE. I am currently learning Typescript with
      React and will hopefully have some projects up in the future.
