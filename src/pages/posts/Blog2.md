I was thinking about adding a theme switcher functionality to this website but not in the typical light or dark mode fashion. 

I recently saw a cool website called Browso (https://www.browso.app/), which gives you a variety of choices to choose from. I want to add something similar to the site but the main questions to ask are, "how many themes do I want', and of course, how do I go about picking the colors to use. 

Speaking of colours however I did come across two sites recently which helps you pick colors, they are ColorSpace (https://mycolor.space/gradient) and Coolors (https://coolors.co/444545-b5ffe9-c5e0d8-c9c9c9-ceabb1).

These two sites help with the color rule of 60 30 10 but whenever I use it I like to cycle through a load of colours before I can even pick.
