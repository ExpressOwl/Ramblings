I was playing around with MongoDB, creating a database of food prices from various supermarkets in the UK. It became obvious early on that it would take a lot of work so I think I am going to web scrape the data using Puppeteer instead. 

On another note I decided to dabble a little bit with Jest and unit testing my apps. To be honest I thought testing in general would have been more complicated but it seems relatively simple, it just takes a little bit of extra time to set up but is worth it because you don't need to constantly console logging your code.
