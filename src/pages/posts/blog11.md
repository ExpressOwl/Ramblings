With more and more sites filling up my projects page I decided it was time to make a reusable component for the layout. With the help of https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/astro-components/#named-slots, it was pretty easy, and I actually feel that is more intuitive than React's props. Both are similar but maybe it feels better because Astro forces you to use its Component Script layout, separated above using the triple hyphen ---.
