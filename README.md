# Portfolio / Blog Site

This is the 2nd version of my portfolio site, my first site was too simple and not scalable. As a result, I decided to make this one with AstroJS and TailwindCSS. (https://seansew.com/projects)

# Features

- Using Astro, I made several components to easily create the skeleton of the site. Astro components are similar to React so I can create a Base layout with the header and footer, and reuse that component without having to copy and paste the entire block of code.

- Astro props are also similar to React but I feel that they are more intuitive to use, maybe because the .astro layout forces you to display props in the component script above, where the imports are.

- Astro Icon allowed for easy image placement without having to list out the src link, and just having to type out the name of the file to display the image.

- Tailwind CSS was used for responsive display for all screen sizes.

# Dependencies

- Astro: Astro is an all-in-one web framework for building fast, content-focused websites.

- Astro Icon: Makes it easier for developers to include images in their Astro projects by providing a simple Icon component that can be used to automatically fetch SVG icons from popular icon packs or from your own folder.

- Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for styling the components.

- pnpm: A package manager which I'm told is the better version of npm. It offers faster installation times and disk space efficiency.

# Development Dependencies

- ESLint: Pluggable JavaScript linter for identifying and reporting code errors and enforcing coding standards.

- Prettier: Opinionated code formatter for maintaining consistent code style and formatting.
